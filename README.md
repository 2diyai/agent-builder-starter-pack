# Agent Builder Starter Pack

**Agent Builder Starter Pack** allows you to easily and safely install all software and resources needed to run simple agentic workflows and experiment with AI agents. It also allows to access locally run LLMs.

It is intended for non technical people who want to experiment with agentic AI on their own computer.

## Know More

**Agent Builder Starter Pack** is built on Docker. Docker uses containers to make software easy to install and run on almost any computer. Instead of installing many tools separately, everything runs inside small, self-contained environments.

You can think of containers as small computers running on your own machine. Each one works independently, but they can communicate with each other when needed. This makes the system more stable, easier to manage, and simpler to remove if required.

The Starter Pack includes three main components:

- **N8N** – This is the orchestration tool. It allows you to design and manage workflows, connect tools together, and build agent-like processes in a visual way.
-  **Ollama** – This runs large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer, so you can experiment with AI without sending data to external services.
-  **Custom Python Service** – This adds extra capabilities that are not available in standard N8N nodes, giving you more flexibility for advanced workflows.

Together, these components create a safe and practical environment to explore agentic AI directly on your own machine.
